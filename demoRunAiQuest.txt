Hi, Shubham!! You have got powers of John McCarthy, and your mission is to find Artificial Intelligence(AI) which lies hidden in the depths of a digital realm. This forest is rumored to be a place where magic and technology intertwine, and where ancient wisdom waits to be discovered. Armed with your trusty laptop and a backpack filled with gadgets, you set off on a journey. Explore in directions north, south, east, west (n,s,e,w). You have got 3 lives.
Start exploration by going north. Provide your first direction to move
